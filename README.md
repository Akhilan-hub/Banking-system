Simple Banking System (Python)

A beginner-friendly command-line banking system built using Python.
This project simulates basic banking operations and helps practice functions, loops, dictionaries, and input validation.

🚀 Features

✔ Create a new bank account
✔ Deposit money
✔ Withdraw money
✔ Check account balance
✔ Handles invalid inputs
✔ Stores account data in memory during program execution

🧠 How It Works

1️⃣ When the program starts, a menu is shown to the user

2️⃣ The user selects an option (1–5)

3️⃣ The program validates the input

4️⃣ Based on the choice, it performs:

Creating an account

Depositing money

Withdrawing money

Showing balance

❌ If the user enters a wrong choice → “Invalid choice!” is shown

❌ If insufficient balance → error message displayed

🧩 Tech Used

Python 3

Dictionaries for storing account details
